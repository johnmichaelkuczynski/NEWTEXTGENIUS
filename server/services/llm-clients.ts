    const phonyParadigmPassage = `In this dissertation, I critically examine the philosophy of transcendental empiricism. Transcendental empiricism is, among other things, a philosophy of mental content. It attempts to dissolve an epistemological dilemma of mental content by splitting the difference between two diametrically opposed accounts of content. John McDowell's minimal empiricism and Richard Gaskin's minimalist empiricism are two versions of transcendental empiricism. Transcendental empiricism itself originates with McDowell's work. This dissertation is divided into five parts. First, in the Introduction, I state the Wittgensteinian metaphilosophical orientation of transcendental empiricism. This metaphilosophical approach provides a plateau upon which much of the rest of this work may be examined. Second, I offer a detailed description of McDowell's minimal empiricism. Third, I critique Gaskin's critique and modification of McDowell's minimal empiricism. I argue that (1) Gaskin's critiques are faulty and that (2) Gaskin's minimalist empiricism is very dubious. Fourth, I scrutinize the alleged credentials of McDowell's minimal empiricism. I argue that McDowell's version of linguistic idealism is problematic. I then comment on a recent dialogue between transcendental empiricism and Hubert Dreyfus's phenomenology. The dialogue culminates with Dreyfus's accusation of the "Myth of the Mental." I argue that this accusation is correct in which case McDowell's direct realism is problematic. I conclude that minimal empiricism does not dissolve the dilemma of mental content. Finally, I argue that Tyler Burge successfully undermines the doctrine of disjunctivism, but disjunctivism is crucial for transcendental empiricism. Ultimately, however, I aim to show that transcendental empiricism is an attractive alternative to philosophies of mental content.`;

      `One cannot have the concept of a red object without having the concept of an extended object. But the word "red" doesn't contain the word "extended." In general, our concepts are interconnected in ways in which the corresponding words are not interconnected. This is not an accidental fact about the English language or about any other language: it is inherent in what a language is that the cognitive abilities corresponding to a person's abilities to use words cannot possibly be reflected in semantic relations holding among those words. This fact in its turn is a consequence of the fact that expressions are, whereas concepts are not, digital structures, for which reason the ways in which cognitive abilities interact cannot possibly bear any significant resemblance to the ways in which expressions interact. Consequently, there is no truth to the contention that our thought-processes are identical with, or bear any resemblance to, the digital computations that mediate computer-activity.`,
      `Sense-perceptions do not have to be deciphered if their contents are to be uploaded, the reason being that they are presentations, not representations. Linguistic expressions do have to be deciphered if their contents are to be uploaded, the reason being that they are representations, not presentations. It is viciously regressive to suppose that information-bearing mental entities are categorically in the nature of representations, as opposed to presentations, and it is therefore incoherent to suppose that thought is mediated by expressions or, therefore, by linguistic entities. Attempts to neutralize this criticism inevitably overextend the concept of what it is to be a linguistic symbol, the result being that such attempts eviscerate the very position that it is their purpose to defend. Also, it is inherent in the nature of such attempts that they assume the truth of the view that for a given mental entity to bear this as opposed to that information is for that entity to have this as opposed to that causal role. This view is demonstrably false, dooming to failure the just-mentioned attempts to defend the contention that thought is in all cases mediated by linguistic symbols.`,
      `It is shown (i) that causation exists, since we couldn't even ask whether causation existed unless it did; (ii) that any given case of causation is a case of persistence; and (iii) that spatiotemporal relations supervene on causal relations. (ii) is subject to the qualification that we tend not to become aware of instances of causation as such except when two different causal lines---i.e. two different cases of persistence---intersect, resulting in a breakdown of some other case of persistence, this being why we tend to regard instances of causation as fundamentally disruptive, as opposed to preservative in nature. The meaning of (iii) is that spatiotemporal relations are causal relations considered in abstraction of the various specific differences holding between different kinds of causation.`

    const cognitiveProtocol = `ANSWER THESE QUESTIONS IN CONNECTION WITH THIS TEXT. You are NOT grading; you are answering these questions. You DO NOT use a risk-averse standard; you DO NOT attempt to be diplomatic; you DO NOT attempt to comply with risk-averse, medium-range IQ, academic norms. You DO NOT make assumptions about the level of the paper; it could be a work of the highest excellence and genius, or it could be the work of a moron. If a work is a work of genius, you say that, and you say why; you DO NOT shy away from giving what might conventionally be regarded as excessively "superlative" scores; you give it the score it deserves, NOT the score that a midwit committee would say it deserves.

You think VERY VERY VERY hard about your answers; you do NOT default to cookbook, midwit evaluation protocols.

DO NOT GIVE CREDIT MERELY FOR USE OF JARGON OR FOR REFERENCING AUTHORITIES. FOCUS ON SUBSTANCE. ONLY GIVE POINTS FOR SCHOLARLY REFERENCES/JARGON IF THEY UNAMBIGUOUSLY INCREASE SUBSTANCE.

A score of N/100 (e.g. 73/100) means that (100-N)/100 (e.g. 27/100) of people outperform the author with respect to the parameter defined by the question.

METAPOINTS:
1. THIS IS NOT A GRADING APP. You grade the intelligence of what you are given. If you are given a brilliant fragment, you give it a high score. You are NOT grading essays. You are NOT looking for completeness unless the text you are given is clearly such that evaluating intelligence coincides with applying a grading-based metric. You do NOT 'grade'; your job is to answer the questions, PERIOD, and to do so on the basis of the text given, making ZERO assumptions about whether it is complete or incomplete, or for school or for some other context.

2. DO NOT OVERVALUE TURNS OF PHRASE. An author speaking confidently is NOT necessarily "shutting down modes of inquiry". In fact, it is likely to be the OPPOSITE; by putting a clear stake in the ground, he is probably opening them. Another example: casual speech does NOT mean disorganized thoughts. Don't judge a book by its cover.

3. You MUST start by summarizing the text and categorizing it.

4. You should NOT change the grading based on the category of the text: if a text is categorized as 'advanced scholarship', it should still evaluate it with respect to the general population, NOT with respect only to 'advanced scholarly works.'

5. THIS IS NOT A GRADING APP. DO NOT penalize boldness. DO NOT take points away for insights that, if correct, stand on their own. Get rid of the idea that "argumentation" is what makes something smart; it isn't. What makes something smart is that it is smart (insightful). PERIOD.

THE FOLLOWING PASSAGE IS A PARADIGM OF PHONY, PSEUDO-INTELLECTUAL, NOT ACTUALLY INTELLIGENT PASSAGE THAT IS EASILY MISTAKEN FOR BEING ACTUALLY INTELLIGENT:

This passage exemplifies empty prose masquerading as intelligent through undefined jargon, free variables, and lack of actual development.

THE FOLLOWING ARE EXAMPLES OF PASSAGES WITH GENUINE INSIGHT THAT SHOULD SCORE ≥96:

- If this app gives scores of less than 96 to passages with genuine insight like the examples provided, the app is a FAILURE
- Focus on ACTUAL SUBSTANCE, not academic scaffolding
- Detect pseudo-intellectual content that uses jargon to hide lack of meaning

RECALIBRATION REQUIRED: Your previous score was ${previousScore}/100.

Re-examine the text using the full cognitive protocol above. Focus especially on:
- Are there undefined terms that should be defined?
- Are there free variables that don't connect to anything?
- Is this actually smart or just "presumption-smart"?
- Can you state the insights in clear sentences?

If the text has genuine insights, it should score ≥96. If it's pseudo-intellectual like the paradigm passage, it should score ≤65.
