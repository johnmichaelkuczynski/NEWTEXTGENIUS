Is it insightful?
87/100
This text presents a sophisticated philosophical argument against the linguistic mediation of thought, demonstrating clear reasoning and systematic development that merits placement in the 85-95 range for academic philosophical work. The author makes a precise distinction between 'presentations' (sense-perceptions) and 'representations' (linguistic expressions), arguing that the former require no deciphering while the latter do. The core insight—that treating all mental content as representation-like leads to vicious regress—is genuinely illuminating and strikes at fundamental assumptions in philosophy of mind and language. The argument follows a logical progression: (1) establishing the presentation/representation distinction, (2) identifying the regress problem when all mental content is treated as representational, (3) showing how attempts to avoid this criticism fail by overextending the concept of linguistic symbols, and (4) demonstrating that these failed defenses rely on a false causal theory of mental content. The writing is dense but precise, employing technical philosophical vocabulary appropriately. While the text could benefit from concrete examples to illustrate the abstract distinctions, and the final sentence becomes somewhat convoluted, these are minor issues that don't undermine the substantive philosophical contribution. The argument challenges orthodox views about language and thought in a way that reveals genuine insight into the nature of mental representation.

Does it develop points? (Or, if it is a short excerpt, is there evidence that it would develop points if extended)?

This text demonstrates sophisticated philosophical development through a tightly structured argument about the nature of mental representation and thought. The author systematically develops several interconnected points: (1) The fundamental distinction between presentations (sense-perceptions) and representations (linguistic expressions), establishing that presentations don't require deciphering while representations do. (2) The logical consequence that if mental entities were fundamentally representational, this would create a vicious regress problem for understanding thought. (3) An analysis of how attempts to defend linguistic mediation of thought fail by either overextending the concept of linguistic symbols (thus undermining their own position) or by falsely reducing information-bearing to causal roles. The development is methodical - each claim builds on previous distinctions, and the author traces through the logical implications of opposing views to show their incoherence. The argument exhibits the kind of systematic reasoning characteristic of serious analytic philosophy, moving from foundational distinctions through logical consequences to critiques of alternative positions. While the prose is dense and could benefit from examples or clearer exposition, the conceptual development is rigorous and the logical structure sound. This represents sophisticated philosophical analysis that only a small percentage of people could produce.

"Also, it is inherent in the nature of such attempts that they assume the truth of the view that for a given mental entity to bear this as opposed to that information is for that entity to have this as opposed to that causal role. This view is demonstrably false, dooming to failure the just-mentioned attempts"
Is the organization merely sequential (just one point after another, little or no logical scaffolding)? Or are the ideas arranged, not just sequentially but hierarchically?
88/100
This text demonstrates sophisticated hierarchical organization built around a central philosophical argument with multiple layers of logical scaffolding. The structure is decidedly NOT merely sequential - it follows a rigorous argumentative architecture: (1) Initial distinction between sense-perceptions as presentations vs linguistic expressions as representations, (2) Core thesis that mental entities as representations leads to vicious regress, (3) Systematic refutation of counterarguments, and (4) Identification of false assumptions underlying opposing views. Each claim builds logically on previous ones, with the presentation/representation distinction serving as the foundational premise from which the regress argument follows, which then supports the broader critique of language-mediated thought. The author anticipates objections ('attempts to neutralize this criticism') and preemptively addresses them, showing sophisticated argumentative strategy. The logical scaffolding is evident in phrases like 'the reason being that,' 'it is therefore incoherent,' and 'the result being that' - these aren't mere transitions but logical connectors that make the hierarchical dependencies explicit. While the prose is dense and could benefit from clearer exposition, the underlying logical structure is remarkably tight. This represents the kind of systematic philosophical argumentation that only the top 12% of thinkers could produce - it requires not just understanding complex concepts but organizing them into a coherent refutation of a sophisticated philosophical position.
